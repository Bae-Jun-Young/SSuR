Lecture materials for "Stochastic Simulation" course.

* .md : These are github markdown documents. Unfortunately, currently github markdown does not support LaTex, thus math equations are not rendered.

* .Rmd : R markdown documents written in Rstudio. Students can download .Rmd files and modify or knit to html and save as pdf files.

* ppt : power point files. Previously, the lecture was based on ppt files but I plan to use markdown documents based materials in the class. 


These materials are based on the book [Introduction to Scientific Programming and Simulation Using R](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Scientific-Programming-Simulation-Chapman/dp/1420068725)
