Sophisticated data structures

Sophisticated data structures
-----------------------------

-   R provides sophisticated structure for the storage and manipulation of data.
    -   simplify data representation, manipulation and analysis.
-   dataframe
    -   is like a matrix,
    -   but extended to allow for different object models in different columns
-   list
    -   is a general data structure that can house many kinds of R object.
-   factor
    -   special variable that represent categorical objects.

Factor
------

-   Data type for ordinal and categorical vectors.
-   The possible values of a factor are referred to as its level.
-   To create a factor, apply function factor to some vector.

``` r
hair <- c("blonde", "black", "brown", "brown", "black", "gray", "none")
(hair <- factor(hair))
```

    ## [1] blonde black  brown  brown  black  gray   none  
    ## Levels: black blonde brown gray none

``` r
levels(hair)
```

    ## [1] "black"  "blonde" "brown"  "gray"   "none"

-   Specify level using `levels` argument.

``` r
hair <- factor(hair, levels=c("black", "blonde", "brown", "gray", "white", "none"))
table(hair)
```

    ## hair
    ##  black blonde  brown   gray  white   none 
    ##      2      1      2      1      0      1

Dataframe
---------

-   Dataframe is a list of vectors (with equal length).
-   Each vector (column) is a variable in experiment.
-   Each row is a single observation.

| Plot | Tree | Species | Diameter | Height |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| 2    | 1    | DF      | 39       | 20.5   |
| 2    | 2    | WL      | 48       | 33.0   |
| 3    | 2    | GF      | 52       | 30.0   |
| ...  | ...  | ...     | ...      | ...    |

### read.table

-   Large dataframe are usually read into R from a file, using `read.table`.

``` r
read.table(file, header=FALSE, sep="")
```

-   `file`
    -   filename to be read, can be relative or absolute.
    -   the same number of values in each row.
    -   the values may be different modes, but the pattern of modes must be the same in each row.
-   `header`
    -   whether or not the first line of the file is the variable names
-   `sep`
    -   gives the character used to separate values in each row.
    -   default `""` has the special interpretation that a variable amount of white space (spaces, tabs, returns) can separate values.

### more about read.table

-   Two commonly used variants of `read.table`
    -   `read.csv(file)`
        -   for comma-separated data
        -   equivalent to `read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep=",")`
    -   `read.delim(file)`
        -   for tab-delimitated data
        -   equivalent to `read.table(file, header=TRUE, sep="\t")`

### Header

-   If a header is present, it is used to name the columns of the dataframe.
-   You can assign your own column names after reading the dataframe (using the `names` function).
-   Or when you read it in, using the `col.names` argument,
    -   which should be assigned a character vector the same lengths of the column number.
-   If there is no head and no `col.names` argument, then R uses the names "V1", "V2", etc.

### read csv file

-   ufc.csv is comma separated and there is a header line.

``` r
ufc <- read.csv("the path of ufc.csv")
```

-   head and tail to examine the object

``` r
head(ufc)
```

    ##   plot tree species dbh.cm height.m
    ## 1    2    1      DF     39     20.5
    ## 2    2    2      WL     48     33.0
    ## 3    3    2      GF     52     30.0
    ## 4    3    5      WC     36     20.7
    ## 5    3    8      WC     38     22.5
    ## 6    4    1      WC     46     18.0

``` r
tail(ufc)
```

    ##     plot tree species dbh.cm height.m
    ## 331  143    1      GF   28.0     21.0
    ## 332  143    2      GF   33.0     20.5
    ## 333  143    7      WC   47.8     20.5
    ## 334  144    1      GF   10.2     16.0
    ## 335  144    2      DF   31.5     22.0
    ## 336  144    4      WL   26.5     25.0

-   Each column has a unique name and we can extract that variable by means of names using `$`.

``` r
x <- ufc$height.m
x[1:5]
```

    ## [1] 20.5 33.0 30.0 20.7 22.5

### accessing element in data.frame

-   We can use `[[?]]` to extract columns.
    -   `ufc$height.m`, `ufc[[5]]` and `ufc[["height.m"]]` are all equivalent.
-   You can extract the elements of a dataframe directly using matrix indexing.

``` r
ufc[1:5, 5]
```

    ## [1] 20.5 33.0 30.0 20.7 22.5

-   To select more than one of the variables in a dataframe, we use `[?]`.
    -   `ufc[4:5]` is equivalent to `ufc[c("dbh.cm", "height.m")]`.

``` r
diam.height <- ufc[4:5]    
diam.height[1:5, ]
```

    ##   dbh.cm height.m
    ## 1     39     20.5
    ## 2     48     33.0
    ## 3     52     30.0
    ## 4     36     20.7
    ## 5     38     22.5

``` r
is.data.frame(diam.height)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

-   Selectin a column using `[[?]]` preserves the mode of the object that is being extracted.

-   Whereas, `[?]` keeps the mode of the object from which the extraction is being made.

``` r
mode(ufc)
```

    ## [1] "list"

``` r
mode(ufc[5])
```

    ## [1] "list"

``` r
mode(ufc[[5]])
```

    ## [1] "numeric"

### creating data.frame and adding column

-   construct a dataframe from a collection of vectors or dataframes

``` r
data.frame(col1=x1, col2=x2, …, df1, df2, …)
```

-   `col1` and `col2` are column names

-   `x1` and `x2` are vectors of equal lengths

-   `df1` and `df2` are dataframes whose columns must be the same length with `x1`, `x2`

-   create a new variable within a dataframe, by naming it and assigning it a value.

``` r
ufc$volume.m3 <- pi*(ufc$dbh.cm/200)^2*ufc$height/2
mean(ufc$volume.m3)
```

    ## [1] 1.93294

### name of column

-   `name(df)` return the names of the dataframe `df`.

-   To change the names of `df` you pass a vector of strings to `names(df)`.

``` r
(ufc.names <- names(ufc))
```

    ## [1] "plot"      "tree"      "species"   "dbh.cm"    "height.m"  "volume.m3"

``` r
names(ufc) <- c("P", "T", "S", "D", "H", "V")
names(ufc)
```

    ## [1] "P" "T" "S" "D" "H" "V"

``` r
names(ufc) <- ufc.names
```

### subset

-   `subset` is a convenient tool for selecting rows of dataframe.
    -   `x %in% y` returns a logical vector whose i-th element is `TRUE` if `x[i]` is in `y`.

``` r
fir.height <- subset(ufc, subset=species %in% c("DF", "GF"), select = c(plot, tree, height.m))
head(fir.height)
```

    ##    plot tree height.m
    ## 1     2    1     20.5
    ## 3     3    2     30.0
    ## 7     4    2     17.0
    ## 8     5    2     29.3
    ## 9     5    4     29.0
    ## 10    6    1     26.0

### write a dataframe

``` r
wirte.table(x, file="", append=FALSE, sep=" ", row.names=TRUE, col.names=TRUE)
```

-   `x` is a dataframe to be written.
-   `file` is the address of the file to write to.
-   `append` indicates whether or not to append.
-   `sep` is the character used to separate the values.
-   `row.name` indicates whether or not to include the row names as the first column.
-   `col.names` indicates whether or not to include the column names as the first row.
