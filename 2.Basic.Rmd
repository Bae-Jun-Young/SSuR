This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

### Branching with if

```R
if (logical_expression) {  
    expression_1	
    …  
}
```

```R
if (logical_expression) {  
    expression_1	
    …  
} else {	
    expression_2 	
    … 
}
```

If logical_expression is TRUE then the first group of expression is executed and the second group of expression is not executed.

Conversely if logical_expression is FALSE then only the second group expression is executed.


If you type  

```R
if (logical_expression) {	 
  expression_1  
  …}  
  else {  
  expression_2  
  …}  
```
then you get an error.

This is because R is believes the if statement is finished before it sees the else part.  
That is, R treats the else as the start of a new command, but there is no command that starts with an else.


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
