Introduction to R
================

### R as a calculating environment

R can be used as a powerful calculator. For arithmetic calculations:

``` r
(1+1/100)^100
```

    ## [1] 2.704814

``` r
17%%5
```

    ## [1] 2

``` r
17%/%5
```

    ## [1] 3

\[1\] implies this is item 1 in a vector of output.

| symbol | meaning          |
|--------|------------------|
| +      | addition         |
| -      | subtraction      |
| \*     | multiplication   |
| /      | division         |
| ^      | exponential      |
| %%     | modulus          |
| %/%    | integer division |

### Built-in function in R

R has a number of built in functions:
sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), exp(x), log(x), sqrt(x), floor(x), ceiling(x), round(x), ???

``` r
exp(1)
```

    ## [1] 2.718282

``` r
options(digits = 16)
exp(1)
```

    ## [1] 2.718281828459045

``` r
pi
```

    ## [1] 3.141592653589793

``` r
sin(pi/6)
```

    ## [1] 0.4999999999999999
